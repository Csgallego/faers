#We start by opening the file drug12q4 (4th quaterly report from the year 2012) that lists the number or complaints for each drug.
#The information is separated by dollar signs so we add: sep="$"
#We noticed that there was a problem with one quotation mark and we solve this problem by adding: quote=""

Yaz12q4 = grepl("(^yaz.*)|(^yasm.*)|(^ocel.*)",drug12q4$drugname,ignore.case=TRUE)

#We create a table of Yaz12q4.
table(drug12q4$drugname[Yaz12q4])

#We sum to see how many complaints there were against Yaz/Yasmin/Ocella in the 4th quarter of 2012.
sum(table(drug12q4$drugname[Yaz12q4]))

#We will now try to expand this search to all the quarterly files to look at the evolution of the complaints against Yaz/Yasmin since January 2006.
